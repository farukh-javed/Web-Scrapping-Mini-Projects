# 📰 Web Scraping Mini Projects

This repository contains three Jupyter Notebook projects focused on web scraping. Two of the projects scrape sports news from popular Pakistani news websites: **Dawn** and **The News**, while the third project scrapes data from the **KTM** website. Each notebook demonstrates how to extract relevant information, such as headlines, descriptions, images, and full articles, and save the data in JSON format.
